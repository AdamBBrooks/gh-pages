      <h2 style="color:#FFF;">Blockchain Design Exercise</h2>
      <p style="color:#FFF; opacity:.5;">Thank you for the opportunity to on this mini project. I've had a lot of fun reimagining the product to introduce two exciting new cryptocurrencies â€” Ethereum Classic and Litecoin.<br><br> I've built a website that not only shows the end result of the exercise, but also dives into the thinking and the process behind the result. I've documented my experience to share the learnings that influenced the product's design and to give you insight into my design choices.</p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">The Challenge</h2>
       <p>Basically, I need to introduce two new cryptocurrencies. My goal is to design an experience that drives adoption of new currencies, by reducing unnecessary friction in the on-boarding process. I'll also need to consider the experience for existing merchants - with the overall goal of improving ease of transactions. My hypothesis is that this redesign would increase the precentage of users successfully on-boarded to the product by purchasing coins.</p>
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Existing Product</h2>
       <p>The existing product features 3 coins within the dashboard with shortcuts to send/receive bitcoin and view transaction history. The initial screen doesn't provide a shortcut to buy, send or request individual currencies.</p>
       <p><img src="img/img1.png" alt="Smiley face" width="100%" align="middle"></p>
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">The Solution</h2>
       <p>I've redesigned the dashboard to display all 5 currencies. Reorganizing the app by currency will reduce unnecessary friction, and allow us to display contextually relevant information and actions for each indivdual currency. The prominent "buy/sell" call-to-action will likely increase adoption of the new coins.<br></p>

    <div class="jumbotron">
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">The Dashboard</h2>
       <p>I've repurposed the dashboard to display all 5 coins. I've chosen a flat skeuomorphic style to represent each currency. A wallet is used as a visual metaphor, although I've avoided the literal representation of a plastic credit card. Cryptocurrencies are something much different! This will require us to find new conventions while leveraging existing patterns, when possible. The QR code is prominently featured on each card to allow accessibility of scanning for those in close physical proximity. This should help achieve the goal of reduced friction, allowing merchants to buy and receive new currencies in just a few taps.</p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Live Pricing</h2>
       <p>Merchants are hesitant to adopt cryptocurrencies as a means of conducting business transactions, due in part to their volatile nature. Minor fluctuations in price could offset any cost benefit of using cryptocurrencies. A live price chart merchants will inform merchants if it's a good time to buy.</p>
       <p><img src="img/Blockchain-2.gif" style="width:180px; box-shadow:0px 20px 40px 1px rgba(68, 68, 68, 0.6);" ></p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="jumbotron">
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Transaction History</h2>
       <p>Transaction history and in-app notifications will be an integral part of improving the user experience of buying and receiving coins. With instant notifications, merchants will be  at ease knowing the status of any transaction.<br>
       <p><img src="img/Blockchain-3.gif" style="width:180px; box-shadow:0px 20px 40px 1px rgba(68, 68, 68, 0.6);"></p>
    </div>

<div class="container">
    <div class="jumbotron">
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">What's next?</h2>
       <p style="margin-bottom:160px;">Cyptocurrencies will continue to provide immense value for merchants, if designers can rise to the challenge of introducing this transformational new technology. Reducing unecsssary friction by leveraging existing conventions and mental models can help us achieve that goal. As a next step - I'd bring in actual customers to test this hypothesis and begin the process of creating a solution that reaches that goal. Thanks for watching!</p>
