      <h2 style="color:#FFF;">Blockchain Design Exercise</h2>
      <p style="color:#FFF; opacity:.5;">Thank you for the opportunity participate in the design exercise. I've had a lot of fun reimagining the product to include two exciting new cryptocurrencies â€” Ethereum Classic and Litecoin.<br><br> I've created this site not only to show the end result, but to dive into the thinking and the process behind it. I've documented my experience to share learnings that influenced the redesign and to provide insight into my design decisions.</p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">The Challenge</h2>
       <p>My task is to introduce two new cryptocurrencies. My goal is to increase conversions on app installs to on-boarded customers who've purchased or received coins. I'll need to consider existing customers as well - designing an experience that improves the ease of buying, selling and receiving coins on the platform not only today, but also in the future as more currencies are introduced.</p>
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Existing Product</h2>
       <p>Before I begin my task, I'll need experience the current on-boarding experience first hand. Upon downloading the app, I'm greeted with a screen that displays the value of 3 coins, each equivalent to $0 USD. A navigation bar provides shortcuts to send/receive coins and view my transaction history. After carefully studying the on-boarding process, I've discovered an opportunity. The current dashboard doesn't provide a shortcut to buy, send or request individual currencies - a potential roadblock to successfully onboarding new customers.</p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">The Solution</h2>
       <p>I've decided to redesign the dashboard to display the new currencies, reorganizing the app in the process. By organizing the dashboard by currency - I can display contextually relevant information and actions for each coin. This restructuring will also allow me to reduce clutter by only displaying the "send" button in context - when a wallet holds coins. Aha! By revealing prominent and clear "buy/sell" calls-to-action, I can increase adoption of the new coins.<br></p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">The Dashboard</h2>
       <p>Visually, I've chosen a flat skeuomorphic style. The wallet, a familiar object is used as a visual metaphor. I've avoided the representation of currencies as physical credit cards. Cryptocurrencies are something much different! The QR code is prominently displayed on each card to allow accessibility for customers scanning within a close physical proximity. This should further help achieve the goal of reduced friction - allowing customers, both online and off to buy and receive new currencies in just a few steps.</p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Live Pricing</h2>
       <p>Customers may be hesitant to adopt new cryptocurrencies, due in part to their volatile nature. Price fluctuations could instantly offset any cost benefit of transacting with them. Live pricing information should display in context when needed, informing a customer if it's a good time to buy.</p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Transaction History</h2>
       <p>Users today have become accustomed to instantaneous feedback when performing tasks. Due to the process of validation and confirmation on a blockchain network, confirming a transaction can take much longer than an instant. The ability to provide instant feedback will be an integral step toward gaining users trust, and in turn increasing adoption. With instant notifications, customers will be at ease knowing the status of a transaction at any given time.<br>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">What's next?</h2>
       <p style="margin-bottom:160px;">Cryptocurrencies will continue to provide immense value for customers, if we as designers can rise to the challenge of introducing this transformational new technology. Reducing unnecessary friction by leveraging existing conventions and mental models should go a long way toward achieving that goal. As a next step - I'd bring in actual customers to test this hypothesis and begin the process of creating a solution that reaches that goal. Thanks for reading!</p>
