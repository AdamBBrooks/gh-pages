      <h2 style="color:#FFF;">Blockchain Design Exercise</h2>
      <p style="color:#FFF; opacity:.5;">Thank you for the opportunity to on this mini project. I've had a lot of fun reimagining the product to introduce two new cryptocurrencies â€” Ethereum Classic and Litecoin.<br><br> I've built a website that not only shows the end result of the design exercise but it also dives into the thinking and the process behind the result. I've documented my experience to share the learnings that influenced the product's design and to give you insight into my design choices.</p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">The Challenge</h2>
       <p>Basically, I need to introduce two exiting new cryptocurrencies. My goal is to design an experience that drives adoption of the new coins, by reducing uncessary friction in the on-boarding process. I also need to consider the experience for existing merchants, with the goal of imrproving ease of transactions. My hypothesis is that this design would increase conversions from app installs, to active users that have on-boarded to the product by purchasing coins.</p>
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Existing Product</h2>
       <p>The existing product features 3 coins within the dashboard along with links to the price chart, send/recieve screens, and transaction history. The initial screen doesn't provide a shortcut to buy, send or request individual currencies.</p>
       <p><img src="img/img1.png" alt="Smiley face" width="100%" align="middle"></p>
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">The Solution</h2>
       <p>I've redesigned the dashboard to display all 5 currencies. Reorganizing the app by currency will reduce uncessary friction, and allow us to display contextually relevant information and actions for each currency. The prominent "buy/sell"  call-to-action will likely increase adoption of the new coins. To reduce clutter and prevent error, I've removed the unecesssary "send: button for those that haven't successfully received or purchased coins.<br></p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">The Dashboard</h2>
       <p>I've repurposed the dashboard to display all 5 coins on a single screen. I've chosen a flat skeumorphic style to represent each currency. A wallet is used as a visual metaphor, although I've avoided the literal representation of a plastic credit card. Cryptocurrencies are something much different! It will require us to find new conventions while leveraging exisitng patterns when possible. The QR code is prominently featured on each square to allow for accessibility of scanning for those in close physical proximity. The goal is to reduce is much friction as possible, allowing merchants to buy and receive new currencies in just a few taps.</p>

       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Live Pricing</h2>
       <p>Lot's of merchants are hesitant to conduct business transactions with cryptocurries, due in part to their volatile nature. Minor fluctuations in price could offset the cost benefit of using cyptocurrencies. With a live price chart merchants will always be aware if it's a good time to buy.</p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="jumbotron">
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Transaction History</h2>
       <p>Transaction history and in-app notifications will be an integral part of improving the user experience of buying and receiving coins. With instant notifications, merchants will be  at ease knowing the status of any transaction.<br>

<div class="container">
    <div class="jumbotron">
       <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">What's next?</h2>
       <p style="margin-bottom:160px;">Cyptocurrencies will continue to provide immense value for merchants, if designers can rise to the challenge of introducing this transformational new technology. My hypothesis is that reducing unecsssary friction by leveraging existing conventions and mental models - we'll go along way toward reaching that goal. As a next step - I'd bring in actual merchants to test the prototype and begint he process of creating something that reaces that goal. Thanks for watching!</p>
